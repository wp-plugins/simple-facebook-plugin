Simple Facebook Plugin enables Facebook Page admins to promote their Pages and embed a simple feed of content from a Page into any WordPress blog. The Facebook **Page Plugin** enables users to:

* See how many users already like this Page, and which of their friends like it too
* Read recent posts from the Page
* Like the Page with one click, without needing to visit the Page

You can easily integrate Like Box using WordPress Widgets and Shortcodes.
